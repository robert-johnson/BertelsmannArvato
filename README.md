## Project Description

In this capstone project we were given information on the general German population provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.  We were asked to identify customers who were most like existing customers, using this German population information.  The goal of this analysis is to focus the marketing efforts/budget for future advertisements on the customer segements that were most likely to respond favorably.
  
This data was provided solely for the durations of this project only and will be deleted after completion of the project
in accordance with Bertelsmann Arvato terms and conditions.

The project has 3 efforts:

**Customer Segmentation**
During this part, techniques to clean, categorize, reduce dimensionality and cluster similar customers were used to correlate the general German population with the customers provided.  The outcome is the identification of features within the dataset, that correspond to target customers.

**Supervised Learning Model**
During this part a supervised learning machine learning model was created and tuned to predicted customer response to a marketing campaign.  Most of the techniques used Customer Segmentation were also applied to the training and test data provided.

**Kaggle Competition**
During this part, the model was used to identify customers, and submit them to the Kaggle website for scoring.
